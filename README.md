# Path Planning

## intro
Path-planning is an important primitive for autonomous mobile
robots that lets robots find the shortest—or otherwise optimal—
path between two points. Optimal paths could be paths that
minimize the amount of turning, the amount of braking or
whatever a specific application requires. Algorithms to find
a shortest path are important not only in robotics, but also in
network routing, video games and understanding protein fold-
ing.
